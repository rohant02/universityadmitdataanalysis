# Questions we wish to answer through this EDA
# 
# 1. How do the number of applications, acceptances, and enrollments vary across institutions?
# 2. What is the acceptance rate and enrollment rate for each institution, and how do these rates vary 
#    between private and public institutions?
# 3. What is the relationship between the percentage of students in the top 10% and top 25% of their high school class and the acceptance rate?
# 4. How does the student-to-faculty ratio impact the graduation rate?  


# Explanation of the data:
# - Apps: Number of applications received
# - Accept: Number of applications accepted
# - Enroll: Number of new students enrolled
# - Top10perc: Percentage of new students from top 10% of high school class
# - Top25perc: Percentage of new students from top 25% of high school class
# - F.Undergrad: Number of full-time undergraduates
# - P.Undergrad: Number of part-time undergraduates
# - Outstate: Out-of-state tuition
# - Room.Board: Room and board costs
# - Books: Estimated book costs
# - Personal: Estimated personal spending
# - PhD: Percentage of faculty with Ph.D.â€™s
# - Terminal: Percentage of faculty with terminal degree
# - S.F.Ratio: Student/faculty ratio
# - perc.alumni: Percentage of alumni who donate
# - Expend: Instructional expenditure per student
# - Grad.Rate: Graduation rate

# And then we add some more columns:
#   AcceptanceRate
#   EnrollmentRate
#   Type_of_institution
